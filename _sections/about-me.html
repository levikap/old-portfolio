<p>Hello! I'm Levi Kaplan, a Computer Science major with a minor in Japanese studying in Boston
  at Northeastern University. I come from a small town in Northern California, so Boston is remarkably
  lively and bitterly cold. I'm currently searching for Co-op or fulltime Internship positions in Software Development,
    with my interests lying in Frontend and Fullstack development. When I'm not programming, you
    might find me at a concert writing or taking photos for Northeastern's Artistry Magazine, or
    trying out a new cooking technique in the kitchen. I'm the lead of a six-person Game Development
    group, and have a number of personal projects I'm currently pursuing; one is a Japanese learning
    app called Jisshuu, and another is a to-do list app called CheckMate.  I'm interested in research
  and am pursuing an opportunity this semester.  My other interests include coffee and reading
colossal fantasy novels.  Enjoy checking out my work!</p>
